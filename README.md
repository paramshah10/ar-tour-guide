# AR Tour Guide

AR Tour Guide is a interactive tour guide app that uses augmented reality to enhance user experience while touring college campuses. This app is currently meant for UCLA but we have plans to expand to college campuses all over California and the U.S. AR Tour Guide is a project through Creative Labs at UCLA led by Param Shah and Suraj Vathsa.
